## How it works
```
|client| <-udp with ack-> |api| -redis pubsub-> |core| -> |redis|
|redis| -ticker-> |sync| -udp without ack-> |client|
```
Authentication and char creation/connection is handled by `auth` and associate a session token at each signin.
`revoker` regularly revokes unused tokens.
GAME_01 also comes with a `tool` API to create world data like entities/abilities/sectors.

## Code architecture
```
 _bin #executables
|
|_cmd_ #executables code
|     |_api #UDP API for game events + ACK client
|     |_auth #HTTPS JSON API for signin/connect
|     |_client #client/server to communicate with API and JSON serialize
|     |_core #order and apply game events
|     |_integration #test integration runner
|     |_revoker #revoke unused tokens
|     |_sync #send entity data to clients
|     |_tool #HTTPS JSON API for world data. Must be private.
