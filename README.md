# GAME_01
> GAME_01 is a multi services scalable MMORPG server

GAME_01 is an UDP client/server with its own ACK protocol. Client writes user action and send them to API while receiving world data from sync. Core establish world rules and events order.
```
client <-> api -> core -> redis-lru
redis-lru -> sync -> client
```
Authentication and char creation/connect is handled by auth and associate a session token at each signin.
Revoker regularly revokes unused tokens.
GAME_01 also comes with a Tool API to create world data like entities/abilities/sectors.

## Code architecture
```

|     |_api #UDP API for game events + ACK client
|     |_auth #HTTPS JSON API for signin/connect
|     |_client #client/server to communicate with API and JSON serialize
|     |_core #order and apply game events
|     |_revoker #revoke unused tokens
|     |_sync #send entity data to clients
|     |_tool #HTTPS JSON API for world data. Must be private.

- [ ] Add context everywhere

## TO DEBATE
